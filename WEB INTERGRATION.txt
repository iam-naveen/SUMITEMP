introdution
     The Olympics is a major international sporting event that takes place every four years. The event brings together athletes from all over the world to compete in various sports and disciplines. The modern Olympic Games were inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD.
The modern Olympics were first organized by Pierre de Coubertin and were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896. Since then, the Olympics have been held regularly, with the exception of a few years during World War I and World War II. The Games alternate between the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics, which are held every four years on a staggered schedule.
